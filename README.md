# EEG Signal Database - DataBaseV1

The `DataBaseV1` database contains a collection of EEG signals focused on spike, slow, and spike-wave morphologies. This database is organized into folders: `Spike_Waves`, `Slow_Waves`, and `Spike_Slow_Waves`, where signals are classified according to the nature and location of EEG events.

## Folder Structure

Within `Spike_Slow_Waves`, signals are distributed in subfolders representing different types of events:

- `Complex`: Contains complex events characterized by clusters or trains of waves lasting over 4 seconds, clearly distinguishable from the EEG background. This category is further divided into:
    - `Middle`: Complex events located in the middle of the signal.
    - `Random`: Complex events appearing randomly in the signal.
- `Transient`: Includes transient events, which correspond to identifiable waves isolated from the background signal.

## File Naming Conventions

Each file in the database follows a specific naming convention that describes the characteristics of the signal:

- `Sp`: Spike Signal.
- `Sl`: Slow Signal.
- `Clpx`: Complex Event.
    - `Midd`: Complex Event Middle.
    - `Rand`: Complex Event Random.
- `Trnt`: Transient Event.
- `NE`: Noise EEG.
- `NW`: Noise Wave.

This naming system allows for quick identification of each signal's main features within the database.
